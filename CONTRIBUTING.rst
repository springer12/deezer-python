Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `deezer-python` for local development.

1. Fork the `deezer-python` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/deezer-python.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper
   installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv deezer-python
    $ cd deezer-python/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass `flake8`_ and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with `tox`_::

        $ flake8
        $ tox

   To get `flake8`_ and `tox`_, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes, quoting github issue in the commit message, if applicable
   and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Fix #XX - My awesome fix"
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests for feature or bug fixes.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and for PyPy.
   Check `Travis`_ as well as `Appveyor`_ and make sure that the tests
   pass for all supported Python versions.
4. If your change is worthwhile a mention in the changelog, update the
   Unreleased section of HISTORY.rst

Create a New Release
--------------------

This project is configured to use `bumpversion
<https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion>`_, only prerequisite
is to have it installed. When the tests have passed and you're happy with the code base, just need to run::

  $ bumpversion [major|minor|patch]

Depending on which digit of the version needs to be updated, and then push with tags::

  $ git push --tags

`Travis`_ will take care of creating the release, and upload it to PyPI.
