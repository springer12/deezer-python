Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``deezer-python`` for local development.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/deezer-python.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper
   installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv deezer-python
    $ cd deezer-python/

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass our
   tests and that the doc builds. The easiest way to do that is by running
   `tox`_ environments::

        $ tox -e lint,docs,py36

   It will run our linters (`flake8`_ and `black`_), build the docs and run the tests

6. Commit your changes, quoting GitHub issue in the commit message, if applicable,
   and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Fix #XX - My awesome fix"
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request on GitHub.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Feel free to open the pull request as soon as possible, but please be explicit
if it's still a work in progress. To be mergeable, pull requests should follow the
following guidelines:

1. It should include tests for feature or bug fixes.
2. If it adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. It should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and for PyPy3.
   Check `Travis`_ as well as `AppVeyor`_ and make sure that the tests
   pass for all supported Python versions.
4. If your change is worthwhile a mention in the changelog, update the
   Unreleased section of ``HISTORY.rst``.

Create a New Release
--------------------

This project is configured to use `bumpversion`_, only prerequisite
is to have it installed. When the tests have passed and you're happy with the code base,
you can bump the version everywhere needed, commit and create a git tag by running::

  $ bumpversion [major|minor|patch]

Then, do a git push, without forgetting about git tags::

  $ git push --tags

`Travis`_ will take care of creating the release, and upload it to PyPI.
